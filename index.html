  <h1> Wrriting assignment 1</h1>
  <p>      The software development process is the sequential format in which a code is programmed for a software, it comprises 5 steps; Requirement gathering, Software design, Implementation, Testing and Maintenance.  Requirement gathering is the first step, it is the active inquiry into software to be designed. In this stage relative questions are asked by the software designer to get the specifics of the code being designed to ensure the code contains everything to suit the client’s needs. Software design is the planning of the code, it includes steps writing pseudocode and is the basis before implementation. It presents the code in an over simplistic way before it is converted to machine language. Implementation is the stage involving the actual typing of the code; here the code is presented in machine language according to the program language being utilized. Testing is the stage that involves making sure the code does what it’s supposed to do and gives the correct and intended output (testing is NOT the same as debugging). Maintenance is the updating of the software code to make sure it meets its requirements over time and suits the client’s needs throughout its use.
    Software design is important as it allows a smooth running of code. It allows the program to be effective,purposeful and organized. Without software design, Software would lack necessary requirements, code might not run successfully and be full of errors. Software Design helps plan out the structure and format of your code before it is typed and run.</p>
 <p>   A software I used that I think was designed well is the IAmAGryphon app available to all students of the University of Guelph. Coming into the school as an international first-year student , there were a lot of events and new information during the O-week that I would have found difficult to keep track of; luckily the IAmAGryphon app helped organize all the programs in an easy-to-read arrangement. The program was very user friendly. The program featured an introductory tutorial and options to change language for international students. It also has many servers for students to connect over platforms of similar interests which makes mass communication very accessible. The software is very comprehensible and features good/ well-designed software.

<h1> Wrriting assignment 2</h1>
<p> The requirements gathering stage is the first stage of the software development process. It kicks off with the software designer asking the clients a series of questions related to the desired software. These questions should be specific enough to give the designer a sufficient idea of what needs to be contained in the software. The answers to these questions then aid the software designer in making  the user stories. The user stories give an overview of what is really needed in the app and for what purpose. This stage is extremely crucial so that the final product suits all the client’s needs perfectly and does not need constant alterations and modifications. If for example, a client was to request an app to be programmed with little to no background information on the function of the app and the app’s main use, the software will be produced in a vague way that fits neither the client's needs nor shows the software designers’ proper skills. Requirement gathering helps give an efficient and useful output.

<p>s a student, I want an in-app calendar, so that I can see event dates on time.</p>
<p>As a student, I want a student club forum, so that I can connect with my peers.</p>
<p>As a student, I want to receive notifications, so that I do not miss important announcements.</p>
<p>As a student, I want a campus map, so that I can find my classes faster.</p>
<p>As a student, I want a chat feature, so that I can communicate with other students.</p>

  <h1> Writing Assignment 3</h1>
  <p> The chapter explores 3 elements of empathy which are Emotion, Culture, and Context. 
    Emotion expresses the necessity of seeing the clients of your products as humans like yourself and realizing they as well have emotions and feelings. Functionality and utility are important aspects when designing a product for general use, but adding features to stimulate the emotional senses of a person also plays a vital part in ensuring customer satisfaction.  
    People are always looking for meaning in the products they buy, this is what Culture means, the product made cannot be meaningless but must hold some sort of cultural relevance. 
    Context explores how the products are being used by consumers. Without the knowledge of the way the goods and services are being utilized, the products cannot reach maximum customer satisfaction.
     The models discussed are Consumers, Literally, Sheep, and Homo Economicus. The Consumers, Literally model observes consumers as being nothing but. The producers see consumers as only a way of gaining profit and discounting their feelings as humans.
       The Sheep model disrespectfully views consumers as easily swayed by trends and popular opinions. It operates by mostly trying to persuade consumers to buy into products with attractive marketing.
       The Homo Economicus model wrongly views consumers as rigid and calculated. This view assumes the main objective of consumers is to get the most at the lowest price.
        The Consumers, Literally model needs Emotion. The model lacks emotion seeing that it does not view consumers as real humans with feelings but as income-generators. The Sheep model needs culture; this model needs to understand that products must have cultural relevance and not just rely on trends and marketing. The Homo Economicus model requires Context, it needs to incorporate the consumers' need for features that actually provide useful functions and not just appear to provide irrelevant functions.
