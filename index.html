  <h1> Wrriting assignment 1</h1>
  <p>      The software development process is the sequential format in which a code is programmed for a software, it comprises 5 steps; Requirement gathering, Software design, Implementation, Testing and Maintenance.  Requirement gathering is the first step, it is the active inquiry into software to be designed. In this stage relative questions are asked by the software designer to get the specifics of the code being designed to ensure the code contains everything to suit the client’s needs. Software design is the planning of the code, it includes steps writing pseudocode and is the basis before implementation. It presents the code in an over simplistic way before it is converted to machine language. Implementation is the stage involving the actual typing of the code; here the code is presented in machine language according to the program language being utilized. Testing is the stage that involves making sure the code does what it’s supposed to do and gives the correct and intended output (testing is NOT the same as debugging). Maintenance is the updating of the software code to make sure it meets its requirements over time and suits the client’s needs throughout its use.
    Software design is important as it allows a smooth running of code. It allows the program to be effective,purposeful and organized. Without software design, Software would lack necessary requirements, code might not run successfully and be full of errors. Software Design helps plan out the structure and format of your code before it is typed and run.</p>
 <p>   A software I used that I think was designed well is the IAmAGryphon app available to all students of the University of Guelph. Coming into the school as an international first-year student , there were a lot of events and new information during the O-week that I would have found difficult to keep track of; luckily the IAmAGryphon app helped organize all the programs in an easy-to-read arrangement. The program was very user friendly. The program featured an introductory tutorial and options to change language for international students. It also has many servers for students to connect over platforms of similar interests which makes mass communication very accessible. The software is very comprehensible and features good/ well-designed software.

<h1> Wrriting assignment 2</h1>
<p> The requirements gathering stage is the first stage of the software development process. It kicks off with the software designer asking the clients a series of questions related to the desired software. These questions should be specific enough to give the designer a sufficient idea of what needs to be contained in the software. The answers to these questions then aid the software designer in making  the user stories. The user stories give an overview of what is really needed in the app and for what purpose. This stage is extremely crucial so that the final product suits all the client’s needs perfectly and does not need constant alterations and modifications. If for example, a client was to request an app to be programmed with little to no background information on the function of the app and the app’s main use, the software will be produced in a vague way that fits neither the client's needs nor shows the software designers’ proper skills. Requirement gathering helps give an efficient and useful output.

<p>s a student, I want an in-app calendar, so that I can see event dates on time.</p>
<p>As a student, I want a student club forum, so that I can connect with my peers.</p>
<p>As a student, I want to receive notifications, so that I do not miss important announcements.</p>
<p>As a student, I want a campus map, so that I can find my classes faster.</p>
<p>As a student, I want a chat feature, so that I can communicate with other students.</p>

  <h1> Writing Assignment 3</h1>
  <p> The chapter explores 3 elements of empathy which are Emotion, Culture, and Context. </p>
  <p>  Emotion expresses the necessity of seeing the clients of your products as humans like yourself and realizing they as well have emotions and feelings. Functionality and utility are important aspects when designing a product for general use, but adding features to stimulate the emotional senses of a person also plays a vital part in ensuring customer satisfaction.  
    People are always looking for meaning in the products they buy, this is what Culture means, the product made cannot be meaningless but must hold some sort of cultural relevance. 
    Context explores how the products are being used by consumers. Without the knowledge of the way the goods and services are being utilized, the products cannot reach maximum customer satisfaction.</p>
   <p>  The models discussed are Consumers, Literally, Sheep, and Homo Economicus. The Consumers, Literally model observes consumers as being nothing but. The producers see consumers as only a way of gaining profit and discounting their feelings as humans.
       The Sheep model disrespectfully views consumers as easily swayed by trends and popular opinions. It operates by mostly trying to persuade consumers to buy into products with attractive marketing.
       The Homo Economicus model wrongly views consumers as rigid and calculated. This view assumes the main objective of consumers is to get the most at the lowest price.</p>
      <p>  The Consumers, Literally model needs Emotion. The model lacks emotion seeing that it does not view consumers as real humans with feelings but as income-generators. The Sheep model needs culture; this model needs to understand that products must have cultural relevance and not just rely on trends and marketing. The Homo Economicus model requires Context, it needs to incorporate the consumers' need for features that actually provide useful functions and not just appear to provide irrelevant functions.

   <h1> Writing Assignment 5</h1>
      <p> A prototype is a vague model of the design of software. It does not represent all the aspects of the final design of the software and it is a fairly undetailed mock-up. It is the representation of an interface that allows for user interaction feedback and refinement. Prototypes are invaluable aspects of the software development process and it poses many benefits.
      Firstly, prototypes inculcate a sense of ‘ownership’ among users. Users feel like they are an active part of the designing process and their part in the evaluation of prototypes leads to the creation of better systems that address user needs better. Secondly, prototyping enables early identification and correction of design flaws. Prototyping hastens rectifications of usability issues early in the development cycle and thus improves the overall system usability. Lastly, prototypes reduce development efforts by eliminating the need to build costly working models upfront and instead opting for more cost-effective versions for testing and communication.</p> 
	<p> One common prototype method is paper prototyping. The process starts with the selection of the most important user and taking note of the most basic and typical tasks they would need to perform. Then, screenshots or sketches of the user interface are created using basic supplies like paper, pens, sticky notes, markers, and more. Usability tests are performed using these paper prototypes. Facilitators, human-computer actors, note-takers, and representative users are also used to obtain and take note of results. Paper prototyping allows for brainstorming, testing, and communication of user interfaces, promoting creativity, multidisciplinary collaboration, and effective problem-solving, thus streamlining the software design process and improving the final product's quality.</p>
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	

<h1> Writing Assignment 6</h1>
  <p> Effective communication is the glue that holds everything in the software design process together and ensures that everyone involved in the project is on the same page. Whether you're a designer, a developer, a project manager, or a client, effective communication is what will make or break your project's success. This essay expatiates three key things that make communication effective: clarity, collaboration, and feedback. </p>
  <p>  First, let's talk about clarity. This is the foundation of everything. Collaborators have to be crystal clear about what the project is all about and what's expected. It's like speaking a language that everyone can understand, whether they're tech-savvy or not. If you can not express your ideas in a way that makes sense to everyone, you are not being clear enough.</p>
   <p>  Next up is collaboration. This is where the 'communication' really comes in. When you bring together a group of people with different perspectives and ideas, you get some serious brainstorming going on. Think of it as a session where everyone can openly share their thoughts and work together to solve problems. This kind of teamwork creates a dynamic and flexible environment that is essential for software development.</p>
      <p>  TFinally, we've got feedback. It's like the radar that helps you navigate through the project. Getting input back from teammates and clients acts as a warning system to tell you what works and what needs to change. They'll point out issues and help you stay on track with your goals. Plus, it allows for continuous improvement and fine-tuning of your project.</p>
	<p>In conclusion, effective communication in software design is all about creating a shared vision, fostering teamwork, and constantly making things better. If these three things are achieved– clarity, collaboration, and feedback – a software designer and their team will be able to build efficient software, deliver high-quality results, and keep clients happy.
One time at my high school, I got picked to design a banner for the newly founded Anime club. I got so excited and put all my favorite shows on the banner and at the club's welcome event the other founding members were unpleasantly surprised that very few of their contributions from our meetings made it in. One thing that I learned from this class that would have helped was if I wrote down suggestions that were brought up so I wouldn't have forgotten to add them to the banner.

	<h1> Writing Assignment 7</h1>
	<p>The design principle I have chosen for this assignment is the accessibility principle. In software design, the accessibility principle's main aim is to design the software for the most people to be able to use it. This principle is important as any software should be designed with the user's experience in mind. It should aim at reaching as large an audience as needed and be designed to help and provide services to as many people as possible. This principle is necessary to ensure that your software is inclusive and diverse, providing users with the best experience possible.
</p>
	<p>One time I noticed this principle in real time was when I got on the bus for the first time. I saw the blue sign with a wheelchair on it and soon learned that it meant the designated space was for disabled passengers who use wheelchairs since they couldn't fit on the normal bus seat. In that scenario, the accessibility principle was used to enhance the experience of people with disabilities so they could also enjoy the amenities of the bus.</p>
        <p>Another aspect where the accessibility design principle was applied is in curb cuts. Curb cuts are those sloped transitions between the sidewalk and the road. This feature was designed for wheelchair access but proved useful to many other users like mothers with strollers, cyclists, and people with luggage on wheels. The accessibility principle that was initially intended to help a specific group ended up improving the lives of many unintended users. It seamlessly transitioned many people from the road to the sidewalk.
</p>
	<p> These two examples highlight exactly what the accessibility design principle is. The principle of accessibility is critical to any software that is being designed to ensure the software can help as many people as it can and provide all the features to help said users make use of all the services proposed.
