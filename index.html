  <p>      The software development process is the sequential format in which a code is programmed for a software, it comprises 5 steps; Requirement gathering, Software design, Implementation, Testing and Maintenance.  Requirement gathering is the first step, it is the active inquiry into software to be designed. In this stage relative questions are asked by the software designer to get the specifics of the code being designed to ensure the code contains everything to suit the client’s needs. Software design is the planning of the code, it includes steps writing pseudocode and is the basis before implementation. It presents the code in an over simplistic way before it is converted to machine language. Implementation is the stage involving the actual typing of the code; here the code is presented in machine language according to the program language being utilized. Testing is the stage that involves making sure the code does what it’s supposed to do and gives the correct and intended output (testing is NOT the same as debugging). Maintenance is the updating of the software code to make sure it meets its requirements over time and suits the client’s needs throughout its use.
    Software design is important as it allows a smooth running of code. It allows the program to be effective,purposeful and organized. Without software design, Software would lack necessary requirements, code might not run successfully and be full of errors. Software Design helps plan out the structure and format of your code before it is typed and run.</p>
 <p>   A software I used that I think was designed well is the IAmAGryphon app available to all students of the University of Guelph. Coming into the school as an international first-year student , there were a lot of events and new information during the O-week that I would have found difficult to keep track of; luckily the IAmAGryphon app helped organize all the programs in an easy-to-read arrangement. The program was very user friendly. The program featured an introductory tutorial and options to change language for international students. It also has many servers for students to connect over platforms of similar interests which makes mass communication very accessible. The software is very comprehensible and features good/ well-designed software.
